                <h3>Zero Waste</h3>
                <p>
                    This edition we are kicking-off our EC ZeroWaste campaign, which we embrace as a long-term goal to
                    reduce, reuse and recycle all the waste generated at the festival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All over the festival area you will find differentiated bins to collect waste selectively,
                    so please pay attention to throw the waste you generate in the right bin! Find the eco promoters
                    at the Activity Tent and get our rewards for bringing your plastic/cardboard/aluminum waste at the
                    recycling points.
                </p>

                <h3>Eco Game</h3>
                <p>
                    For all of the Electric Castle campers, distinguished residents of the festival, we designed a fun
                    contest to motivate you to take care of the castle and its surroundings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find the ECO Spot in the main square of the camping and become Guardian, Angel or Legend of the
                    ECO program and you can win a <a href="http://iute.bike/" target="_blank">iute.bike</a>, a 2018 VIP pass and other prizes.
